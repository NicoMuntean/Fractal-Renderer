# Fractal-Renderer
## Overview

The *Fractal Renderer* project is a vanilla Java developed ***first sketchout*** of a 3D [Ray-Marching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_marching#:~:text=Ray%20marching%20is%20a%20class,points%20from%20a%203D%20scan.) based rendering engine, capable of visualizing a range of 3D fractals. As of now, the functionality is very limited, with the only fractal supported being the ***Mandelbulb***. The current state of the application does not posess a GUI, with the parametrs for the fractals, camera and lighting having to be written directly in the source code.
