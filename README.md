# Fractal-Renderer
## Overview

The *Fractal Renderer* project is a vanilla Java developed ***first sketchout*** of a 3D [Ray-Marching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_marching) based rendering engine, capable of visualizing a range of 3D fractals. As of now, the functionality is very limited, with the only fractal supported being the [Mandelbulb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbulb). The current state of the application does not posess a GUI, with the parametrs for the *fractals, camera and lighting* having to be written directly in the source code. 

## Current Features

### Supported Shapes and Fractals
Currently, the *Fractal Renderer* only supports the visualization of ***Spheres*** and ***Mandelbulb fractals***of differing paramters. Taking the *Mandelbulb* as an example, these parameters consist of:
- ***Mandelbulb Center Position***
  - Defines the relative center position of the Mandelbulb
- ***Mandelbulb Radius***
  - Defines the dispersion relation of the coordinates of the render construct to the Mandelbulb set
- ***Power***
  - Defines the power of the Mandelbulb
- ***Color***
  - Defines the natural color of the Mandelbulb assuming full illumination
- ***Shinyness***
  - Defines the *shinyness* coefficient used in the Phong illumination model
- ***Stretch coefficient***
  - Defines the grade to which the shape of the Mandelbulb is stretched/compressed
- ***Yaw***:
  - Defines the initial *yaw* of the Mandelbulb
- ***Pitch***
  - Defines the intial *pitch* of the Mandelbulb
- ***Roll**
  - Defines the initial *roll* of the Mandelbulb
