# Fractal-Renderer
## Overview

The *Fractal Renderer* project is a vanilla Java developed ***first sketchout*** of a 3D [Ray-Marching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_marching) based rendering engine, capable of visualizing a range of 3D fractals. As of now, the functionality is very limited, with the only fractal supported being the [Mandelbulb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbulb). The current state of the application does not posess a GUI, with the parametrs for the *fractals, camera and lighting* having to be written directly in the source code. 

## Current Features

### Supported Shapes and Fractals
Currently, the *Fractal Renderer* only supports the visualization of ***Spheres*** and ***Mandelbulb fractals***of differing paramters. 
### Rendering techniques
The *Fractal Re
